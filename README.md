## Developing

### Contribution Guidelines

Go read [our contribution guidelines](/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get a bit more familiar with how
we would like things to flow.

### Requirements

* [Apache Maven 3.3.3+](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
* [Java 8+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* Network access to https://repository.sonatype.org/content/groups/sonatype-public-grid

Also, there is a good amount of information available at [Bundle Development](https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Bundle+Development#BundleDevelopment-BundleDevelopmentOverview)

NOTE: Version 0.0.2+ of Conan is only compatible with Nexus Repo 3.11.0 or greater due to adding Tree View Filtering. If 
you need to use this plugin with an older version, please use 0.0.1

### Building

To build the project and generate the bundle use Maven

    mvn clean install

If everything checks out, the bundle for Conan should be available in the `target` folder

#### Build with Docker

`docker build -t nexus-repository-conan:0.0.6 .`

#### Run as a Docker container

`docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name nexus nexus-repository-conan:0.0.6` 

For further information like how to persist volumes check out [the GitHub repo for our official image](https://github.com/sonatype/docker-nexus3).

The application will now be available from your browser at http://localhost:8081

## Using Conan With Nexus Repository Manager 3

[We have detailed instructions on how to get started here!](docs/CONAN_USER_DOCUMENTATION.md)

## Installing the plugin

There are a range of options for installing the Conan plugin. You'll need to build it first, and
then install the plugin with the options shown below:

### Temporary Install

Installations done via the Karaf console will be wiped out with every restart of Nexus Repository. This is a
good installation path if you are just testing or doing development on the plugin.

* Enable Nexus console: edit `<nexus_dir>/bin/nexus.vmoptions` and change `karaf.startLocalConsole`  to `true`.

  More details here: https://help.sonatype.com/display/NXRM3/Bundle+Development#BundleDevelopment-InstallingBundles

* Run Nexus' console:
  ```
  # sudo su - nexus
  $ cd <nexus_dir>/bin
  $ ./nexus run
  > bundle:install file:///tmp/nexus-repository-conan-0.0.6.jar
  > bundle:list
  ```
  (look for org.sonatype.nexus.plugins:nexus-repository-conan ID, should be the last one)
  ```
  > bundle:start <org.sonatype.nexus.plugins:nexus-repository-conan ID>
  ```

### (more) Permanent Install

For more permanent installs of the nexus-repository-conan plugin, follow these instructions:

* Copy the bundle (nexus-repository-conan-0.0.6.jar) into <nexus_dir>/deploy

This will cause the plugin to be loaded with each restart of Nexus Repository. As well, this folder is monitored
by Nexus Repository and the plugin should load within 60 seconds of being copied there if Nexus Repository
is running. You will still need to start the bundle using the karaf commands mentioned in the temporary install.

### (most) Permanent Install

If you are trying to use the Conan plugin permanently, it likely makes more sense to do the following:

* Copy the bundle into `<nexus_dir>/system/org/sonatype/nexus/plugins/nexus-repository-conan/0.0.6/nexus-repository-conan-0.0.6.jar`
* If you are using OSS edition, make these mods in: `<nexus_dir>/system/com/sonatype/nexus/assemblies/nexus-oss-feature/3.x.y/nexus-oss-feature-3.x.y-features.xml`
* If you are using PRO edition, make these mods in: `<nexus_dir>/system/com/sonatype/nexus/assemblies/nexus-pro-feature/3.x.y/nexus-pro-feature-3.x.y-features.xml`
   ```
         <feature version="3.x.y.xy" prerequisite="false" dependency="false">nexus-repository-rubygems</feature>
         <feature version="0.0.6" prerequisite="false" dependency="false">nexus-repository-conan</feature>
         <feature version="3.x.y.xy" prerequisite="false" dependency="false">nexus-repository-yum</feature>
     </features>
   ```
   And
   ```
       <feature name="nexus-repository-conan" description="org.sonatype.nexus.plugins:nexus-repository-conan" version="0.0.6">
        <details>org.sonatype.nexus.plugins:nexus-repository-conan</details>
        <bundle>mvn:org.sonatype.nexus.plugins/nexus-repository-conan/0.0.6</bundle>
       </feature>
    </features>
   ```
This will cause the plugin to be loaded and started with each startup of Nexus Repository.

## The Fine Print

It is worth noting that this is **NOT SUPPORTED** by Sonatype, and is a contribution of ours
to the open source community (read: you!)

Remember:

* Use this contribution at the risk tolerance that you have
* Do NOT file Sonatype support tickets related to Conan support
* DO file issues here on GitHub, so that the community can pitch in

Phew, that was easier than I thought. Last but not least of all:

Have fun creating and using this plugin and the Nexus platform, we are glad to have you here!
